# Projects & Research
* * *

## Graduate Major Research Project 
-   [Final Research Paper](/img/ElianasMRP.pdf): This project investigates the reliability, alignment, and fairness of ChatGPT-generated interview evaluations compared to human ratings in automated video interview (AVI) settings. Using a sample of 183 transcribed candidate responses, I assessed how closely AI-generated scores matched those of trained human evaluators, and whether this alignment varied across gender, race, and age subgroups.
- Results showed a strong overall correlation between ChatGPT and human ratings (ICC = 0.94), but also revealed significant divergences: ChatGPT consistently scored candidates higher and showed concerning bias patterns, particularly underrating Black participants and overrating middle-aged ones; discrepancies that were not present in human ratings.
- This research highlights both the potential and ethical limitations of using large language models in hiring processes and emphasizes the need for human oversight and fairness audits when deploying AI evaluation tools.
- [Results Table](/img/APAtable.pdf): This APA-style table summarizes the results of subgroup analyses comparing AI and human interview ratings, highlighting where ChatGPT's assessments diverged significantly across demographic lines (e.g., race and age), raising concerns about fairness and potential bias in AI-driven hiring tools.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Statistical analysis in R and Python (t-tests, ICC, Pearson correlation, Fisherâ€™s r-to-z)
- Algorithmic auditing and bias detection
- Research design and experimental prompting using the OpenAI API
- Expertise in AI ethics, HR tech evaluation, and sociotechnical analysis
- Written, visual, and oral communication of research findings

## Undergraduate Thesis
-   [Undergraduate Thesis Paper](/img/final_paper.pdf):  This is my finalized undergraduate honours thesis project, a paper entitled: "Exploring Ethical Considerations: Generative AI's Impact on Current & Future HR Practices". In this paper I explore GAI's ethical impact(s) on the many day to day job tasks of HR professionals and the possible implications this has for current and future work in HR.
-   [Final Poster](/img/final_poster.pdf): This is my final thesis poster relating to the study I conducted (above). 
-   [Final Slides](/img/final_slides.pdf): This is a copy of my research proposal slides, made for for my undergraduate thesis.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Ethical analysis of emerging technologies in HR
- Interdisciplinary literature review and academic writing
- Independent research design and project management
- Written, visual, and oral communication of research findings
- Applied understanding of generative AI in workplace contexts
