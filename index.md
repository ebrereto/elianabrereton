Hi there! 
===

### Welcome to my personal website & portfolio. 

I’m Eliana, a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics based in Ontario, Canada.

My focus lies in responsible AI governance, with particular interest in how AI systems impact hiring, work, and decision-making. I’m passionate about building fair, accountable, and human-centered technologies, and I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute research, analysis, and ethical insight to real-world AI applications.

Navigate through the different sections above to learn more about my background, education, current projects, and research (and learn where you can contact me).

Have a great day, and thanks for stopping by!
