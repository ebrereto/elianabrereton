# Education & Volunteering

* * *
## Education
* * *
**M.A., Philosophy of Data Science | University of Guelph** 
(_Sept. 2024 - Current_)
- My (in-progress) research project critically examines the performance of Automated Video Interview (AVI) systems by comparing AI-generated transcription assessments against human-rater interview evaluations, providing an empirical  analysis of AI reliability in recruitment.
- My research specifically focuses on identifying patterns of agreement vs. divergence between AI and human ratings, also looking across demographic subgroups, including gender, race, and age.
- I aim to uncover potential biases in AI-driven hiring tools, and further explore the ethical implications of allowing AI to influence recruitment decisions.
- Through this project, I am developing advanced skills in statistical analysis (with R and Python), along with data analysis, algorithmic auditing, and ethical evaluation frameworks, positioning me for roles in AI ethics, governance, and data-driven research.
